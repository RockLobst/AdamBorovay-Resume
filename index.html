        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I'm Adam, and I'm an experienced restaurant industry professional with several years of experience working in various roles within the industry. I have a passion for providing excellent customer service, working with others, and maintaining a high level of professionalism in every aspect of my job. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to work well with others. I thrive in a team environment and am skilled in communication, problem-solving, and organization. I believe that collaboration is key to achieving success in any workplace, and I'm committed to bringing a positive attitude and a strong work ethic to every job I undertake.<br><br>

        My restaurant industry experience began at Pieology, where I was a team member. At Pieology, I learned how to make pizzas, operate ovens, prep toppings, wash dishes, and maintain a clean and efficient working environment. The fast-paced atmosphere taught me how to stay calm and focused under pressure while providing top-notch customer service. From there, I moved on to Tavern 101, where I worked as a busser and waiter. I was responsible for running food, bussing tables, sweeping and mopping, and assisting other staff members. I also took orders over the phone and through delivery services like DoorDash and Grubhub. My exceptional customer service skills and outgoing personality made customers feel welcome and valued, and I loved making their experience at Tavern 101 as pleasant as possible. Aside from my work in the restaurant industry, I've also gained valuable experience working with children. As a counselor in training (CIT) at Brandice Summer Camp, I worked with kids of all ages and took on leadership roles. I orchestrated activities, provided guidance, and helped ensure that every child had a positive and fun experience at camp. I also worked as an aid at Willow Elementary, where I helped younger kids with their homework and provided supervision. In addition to my experience working with children, I also have experience working in a different field, as an assistant at Marketing Creatively. There, I assisted in managing direct shipments for postal services, communicated with clients over products, and handled pickups and deliveries of printed materials. This experience gave me a broader understanding of how businesses operate outside of the restaurant industry and honed my customer service and communication skills.<br><br>

        Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in political science at U.C. Riverside and completing an associate's degree in criminal justice from Moorpark College. My educational background and industry experience have helped me develop critical thinking, public speaking, and research skills that I can apply to any professional endeavor. In summary, my experience in the restaurant industry and other fields has given me a diverse skill set that I can bring to any job. I'm a team player with excellent communication and problem-solving skills, and I'm committed to providing exceptional customer service in everything I do. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a professional, and I look forward to contributing my skills and experience to any workplace I join in the future.
